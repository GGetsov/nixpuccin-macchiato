# nixpuccin-macchiato

## What is this?
Nixpuuccin-macchiato is a nix package that overlays the catppuccin-gtk and gnome-shell packages. Basically creates a macchito theme with "Text" accent color and also applies it as a gnome-shell theme for gdm too.

## Why?
I really like the "Black and White" combination, that having "Text" as accent color creates. Why a separate package? I don't want 99% of my config being css. It is very specific but it can be used as a template to customize the gtk them as to add the text or any other accent color to any of the 4 flavors or as a template for creating a gdm gnome-shell theme.

## How to use?
IDK yet WIP.
